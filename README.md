# Z83-Portal-Solution

This repository holds the entire project file for the Z83 Portal Solution, the documentations and the GitHub actions for committing changes and deployment.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES

The Z83 Online Job Application solution is a Microsoft Power Platform portal solution designed for the South African government and its public sectors. This automated solution is developed based on Z83 requirements and has been setup to enable public users to make online job applications, as opposed to manually filling out a government regulated Z83 form to apply for an advertised job within the public sector.Â 

The Z83 Job Portal is built to better manage published job vacancies and to support online applications according to the Z83 format.

This solution eliminates the lengthy manual process of completing a physical Z83 application form and allows for the digitization of the Z83 form. Through the Z83 portal, which is an online website, the process is automated â€“ making it quick and easy for candidates to apply for a job online. Click Here!Â to access the portal.Â 

## Objectives
The goal is to eliminate the manual process of a candidate (i.e. public user) having to complete a Z83 form to apply for a job, by visiting the government office in person or using the governmentâ€™s intranet site to download and fill out the form. 

The introduction of an automated system simplifies the job application process from the eRecruitment phase: 

Which is digitizing the Z83 application form
Includes the sending out of email notification messages to a candidateâ€™s valid email addresses
oIncludes auto-generating and storing the completed Z83 application form on a SharePoint library, for storage and easy accessibility.  

To the Integration Phase:
This is integrating the Z83 digital form into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (the Human Resources module). 
This integration allows for a Recruiter to receive a job application for application processing (i.e. to validate and review it).
This integration supports the interview process, candidate selection and the conversion of a candidate into a new hire (i.e. employee onboarding)
